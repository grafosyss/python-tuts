    "Python comes with a large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality, known as the standard library.The NumPy extension, for instance, has been described as a free and more powerful equivalent to the Matlab numeric programming system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Component integration\n",
    "Python scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application, using a variety of integration mechanisms. Such integrations allow Python to be used as a product customization and extension tool. Today, Python code can invoke C and\n",
    "C++ libraries, can be called from C and C++ programs, can integrate with Java and .NET components, can communicate over frameworks such as COM and Silverlight, can interface with devices over serial ports, and can interact over networks\n",
    "with interfaces like SOAP, XML-RPC, and CORBA. It is not a standalone tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoyment\n",
    "Because of Python’s ease of use and built-in toolset, it can make the act of programming more pleasure than chore. Although this may be an intangible benefit,its effect on productivity is an important asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python user base:\n",
    "• Google makes extensive use of Python in its web search systems.\n",
    "• The popular YouTube video sharing service is largely written in Python.\n",
    "• The Dropbox storage service codes both its server and desktop client software primarily in Python.\n",

    "• NASA, Los Alamos, Fermilab, JPL, and others use Python for scientific programming tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Can I Do with Python?\n",
    "In addition to being a well-designed programming language, Python is useful for accomplishing real-world tasks—the sorts of things developers do day in and day out.It’s commonly used in a variety of domains, as a tool for scripting other components\n",
    "and implementing standalone programs. In fact, as a general-purpose language,Python’s roles are virtually unlimited: you can use it for everything from website development and gaming to robotics and spacecraft control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems Programming\n",
    "Python’s built-in interfaces to operating-system services make it ideal for writing portable, maintainable system-administration tools and utilities (sometimes called shell tools). Python programs can search files and directory trees, launch other programs, do parallel processing with processes and threads, and so on.Python’s standard library comes with POSIX bindings and support for all the usual OS tools: environment variables, files, sockets, pipes, processes, multiple threads, regular expression pattern matching, command-line arguments, standard stream interfaces,shell-command launchers, filename expansion, zip file utilities, XML and JSON parsers, CSV file handlers, and more. In addition, the bulk of Python’s system interfacesare designed to be portable; for example, a script that copies directory trees typically runs unchanged on all major Python platforms. The Stackless Python implementation,described in Chapter 2 and used by EVE Online, also offers advanced solutions to multiprocessing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "GUIs\n",
    "Python comes with a standard object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI API called tkinter that allows Python programs\n",
    "to implement portable GUIs with a native look and feel. Python/tkinter GUIs run unchanged on Microsoft Windows, X Windows (on Unix and Linux), and the Mac OS(both Classic and OS X). \n",
    "\n",
    "Internet Scripting\n",
    "Python comes with standard Internet modules that allow Python programs to perform a wide variety of networking tasks, in client and server modes. Scripts can communicate over sockets; extract form information sent to server-side CGI scripts; transfer files by FTP; parse and generate XML and JSON documents; send, receive, compose, and parse email; fetch web pages by URLs; parse the HTML of fetched web pages; communicate over XML-RPC, SOAP, and Telnet; and more. Python’s libraries make these tasks remarkably simple. In addition, a large collection of third-party tools are available on the Web for doing Internet programming in Python. For instance, the HTMLGen system generates HTML files from Python class-based descriptions, the mod_python package runs Python efficiently within the Apache web server and supports server-side templating with its Python Server Pages, and the Jython system provides for seamless Python/Java integration and supports coding of server-side applets that run on clients.In addition, full-blown web development framework packages for Python, such as Django, TurboGears, web2py, Pylons, Zope, and WebWare, support quick construction of full-featured and production-quality websites with Python. Many of these include features such as object-relational mappers, a Model/View/Controller architecture,server-side scripting and templating, and AJAX support, to provide complete and enterprise-level web development solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, Python has expanded into rich Internet applications (RIAs), with tools such as Silverlight in IronPython, and pyjs (a.k.a. pyjamas) and its Python-to-JavaScript compiler, AJAX framework, and widget set. Python also has moved into cloud computing, with App Engine, and others described in the database section ahead. Where the Web leads, Python quickly follows.\n",
    "Component Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Database Programming\n",
    "For traditional database demands, there are Python interfaces to all commonly used relational database systems—Sybase, Oracle, Informix, ODBC, MySQL, PostgreSQL.The Python world has also defined a portable database API for accessing SQL database systems from Python scripts, which looks the same on a variety of underlying database systems. For instance, because the vendor interfaces implement the portable API, a script written to work with the free MySQL system will work largely unchanged on other systems (such as Oracle); all you generally have to do is replace the underlying vendor interface. The in-process SQLite embedded SQL database engine is a standard part of Python, supporting both prototyping and basic program storage needs.\n",
    "In the non-SQL department, Python’s standard pickle module provides a simple object persistence system—it allows programs to easily save and restore entire Python objects to files and file-like objects. On the Web, you’ll also find third-party open source systems named ZODB and Durus that provide complete object-oriented database systems for Python scripts; others, such as SQLObject and SQLAlchemy, that implement object relational mappers (ORMs), which graft Python’s class model onto relational tables;and PyMongo, an interface to MongoDB, a high-performance, non-SQL, open source JSON-style document database, which stores data in structures very similar to Python’s own lists and dictionaries, and whose text may be parsed and created with Python’s\n",
    "own standard library json module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google’s App Engine, which models data with Python classes and provides extensive scalability, as well as additional emerging cloud storage options such as Azure, PiCloud, OpenStack, and Stackato.Rapid Prototyping To Python programs, components written in Python and C look the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric and Scientific Programming\n",
    "Python is also heavily used in numeric programming—a domain that would not traditionally have been considered to be in the scope of scripting languages, but has grown to become one of Python’s most compelling use cases.NumPy high-performance numeric programming extension for Python mentioned earlier includes such advanced tools as an array object, interfaces to standard mathematical libraries, and much more. By integrating Python with numeric routines coded in a compiled language for speed, NumPy turns Python into a sophisticated yet easy-to-use numeric programming tool that can often replace existing code written in traditional compiled languages such as FORTRAN or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional numeric tools for Python support animation, 3D visualization, parallel processing, and so on. The popular SciPy and ScientificPython extensions, for example,provide additional libraries of scientific programming tools and use NumPy as a core\n",
    "component. The PyPy implementation of Python has also gained traction in the numeric domain, in part because heavily algorithmic code of thesort that’s common in this domain can run dramatically faster in PyPy—often 10X to100X quicker.\n",
    "And More: Gaming, Images, Data Mining, Robots, Excel...\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is commonly applied in more domains than can be covered here. For example,\n",
    "you’ll find tools that allow you to use Python to do:\n",
    "• Game programming and multimedia with pygame, cgkit, pyglet, PySoy,Panda3D, and others\n",
    "• Serial port communication on Windows, Linux, and more with the PySerial extension\n",
    "• Image processing with PIL and its newer Pillow fork, PyOpenGL, Blender, Maya,and more\n",
    "• Robot control programming with the PyRo toolkit\n",
    "• Natural language analysis with the NLTK package\n",
    "• Instrumentation on the Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards\n",
    "• Mobile computing with ports of Python to the Google Android and Apple iOS platforms\n",
    "• Excel spreadsheet function and macro programming with the PyXLL or DataNitro add-ins\n",
    "• Media file content and metadata tag processing with PyMedia, ID3, PIL/Pillow,and more\n",
    "• Artificial intelligence with the PyBrain neural net library and the Milk machinelearning toolkit\n",
    "• Expert system programming with PyCLIPS, Pyke, Pyrolog, and pyDatalog\n",
    "• Network monitoring with zenoss, written in and customized with Python\n",
    "• Python-scripted design and modeling with PythonCAD, PythonOCC, FreeCAD,and others\n",
    "• Document processing and generation with ReportLab, Sphinx, Cheetah, PyPDF,and so on\n",
    "• Data visualization with Mayavi, matplotlib, VTK, VPython, and more\n",
    "• XML parsing with the xml library package, the xmlrpclib module, and third-party extensions\n",
    "• JSON and CSV file processing with the json and csv modules\n",
    "• Data mining with the Orange framework, the Pattern bundle, Scrapy, and customcode\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Strengths\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented language, from the ground up. Its class model supports advanced notions such as polymorphism, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance; yet, in the context of Python’s simple syntax and typing, OOP is remarkably easy\n",
    "to apply. In fact, if you don’t understand these terms, you’ll find they are much easier to learn with Python than with just about any other OOP language available.Besides serving as a powerful code structuring and reuse device, Python’s OOP nature\n",
    "makes it ideal as a scripting tool for other object-oriented systems languages. For example, with the appropriate glue code, Python programs can subclass (specialize)classes implemented in C++, Java, and C#.Of equal significance, OOP is an option in Python. Its object-oriented tools can be applied ifand when constraints allow.\n",
    "In addition to its original procedural (statement-based) and object-oriented (classbased) paradigms, Python in recent years has acquired built-in support for functional programming—a set that by most measures includes generators, comprehensions, closures, maps, decorators, anonymous function lambdas, and first-class function objects.These can serve as both complement and lternative to its OOP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s Free\n",
    "Python is completely free to use and distribute. As with other open source software,such as Tcl, Perl, Linux, and Apache, you can fetch the entire Python system’s source code for free on the Internet. There are no restrictions on copying it, embedding it in your systems, or shipping it with your products. In fact, you can even sell Python’s source code,Python development is performed by a community that largely coordinates its efforts over the Internet. It consists of Python’s original creator—Guido\n",
    "van Rossum, the officially anointed Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) of Python—plus a supporting cast of thousands. Language changes must follow a formal enhancement procedure and be scrutinized by both other developers and the BDFL. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s Portable\n",
    "The standard implementation of Python is written in portable ANSI C, and it compiles and runs on virtually every major platform currently in use. For example, Python programs run today on everything from PDAs to supercomputers. As a partial list, Python\n",
    "is available on:\n",
    "• Linux and Unix systems\n",
    "• Microsoft Windows (all modern flavors)\n",
    "• Mac OS (both OS X and Classic)\n",
    "• BeOS, OS/2, VMS, and QNX\n",
    "• Real-time systems such as VxWorks\n",
    "• Cray supercomputers and IBM mainframes\n",
    "• Cell phones running Symbian OS, and Windows Mobile\n",
    "• Gaming consoles and iPods\n",
    "• Tablets and smartphones running Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS\n",
    "• And more\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides all the simplicity\n",
    "and ease of use of a scripting language, along with more advanced software-engineering tools typically found in compiled languages. Unlike some scripting languages, this combination makes Python useful for large-scale development projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing\n",
    "Python keeps track of the kinds of objects your program uses when it runs; it doesn’t require complicated type and size declarations in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic memory management\n",
    "Python automatically allocates objects and reclaims (“garbage collects”) them when they are no longer used, and most can grow and shrink on demand. As you’ll learn, Python keeps track of low-level memory details so you don’t have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming-in-the-large support\n",
    "For building larger systems, Python includes tools such as modules, classes, and exceptions. These tools allow you to organize systems into components, use OOP to reuse and customize code, and handle events and errors gracefully. Python’s functional programming tools, described earlier, provide additional ways to meet many of the same goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in object types\n",
    "Python provides commonly used data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and strings as intrinsic parts of the language; as you’ll see, they’re both flexible and easy to use. For instance, built-in objects can grow and shrink on demand, can be arbitrarily nested to represent complex information, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in tools\n",
    "To process all those object types, Python comes with powerful and standard operations, including concatenation (joining collections), slicing (extracting sections), sorting, mapping, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Library utilities\n",
    "For more specific tasks, Python also comes with a large collection of precoded library tools that support everything from regular expression matching to networking. Once you learn the language itself, Python’s library tools are where much\n",
    "of the application-level action occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third-party utilities\n",
    "Because Python is open source, developers are encouraged to contribute precoded tools that support tasks beyond those supported by its built-ins; on the Web, you’ll find free support for COM, imaging, numeric programming, XML, database access, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s Relatively Easy to Learn\n",
    "This brings us to the point of this book: especially when compared to other widely used programming languages, the core Python language is remarkably easy to learn. Python is named after the British comedy group Monty Python—makers of the 1970s BBC comedy series Monty Python’s FlyingCircus and a handful of later full-length films, including Monty Python and the Holy Grail, that are still widely popular today. Python’s original creator was a fan of Monty Python."

    "The Python Interpreter\n",
    "An interpreter is a kind of program that executes other programs. When you write a Python program,the Python interpreter reads your program and carries out the instructions it contains.In effect, the interpreter is a layer of software logic between your code and the computer hardware on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte code compilation\n",
    "Internally, and almost completely hidden from you, when you execute a program Python first compiles your source code (the statements in your file) into a format known as byte code. Compilation is simply a translation step, and byte code is a lower-level,platform-independent representation of your source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source changes: Python automatically checks the last-modified timestamps of source and byte code files to know when it must recompile—if you edit and resave your source code, byte code is automatically re-created the next time your program\n",
    "is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python versions: Imports also check to see if the file must be recompiled because it was created by a different Python version, using either a “magic” version number in the byte code file itself in 3.2 and earlier, or the information present in byte code\n",
    "filenames in 3.2 and later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Virtual Machine (PVM)\n",
    "Once your program has been compiled to byte code (or the byte code has been loaded from existing .pyc files), it is shipped off for execution to something generally known as the Python Virtual Machine (PVM, for the more acronym-inclined among you).PVM sounds more impressive than it is; really, it’s not a separate program, and it need not be installed by itself. In fact, the PVM is just a big code loop that iterates through your byte code instructions, one by one, to carry out their operations. The PVM is the runtime engine of Python; it’s always present as part of the Python system, and it’s the component that truly runs your scripts. Technically, it’s just the last step of what is called the “Python interpreter.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance implications\n",
    "There is usually no build or “make” step in Python work: code runs immediately after it is written. For another, Python byte\n",
    "code is not binary machine code (e.g., instructions for an Intel or ARM chip). Byte code is a Python-specific representation.\n",
    "This is why some Python code may not run as fast as C or C++ code, as described in the PVM loop, not the CPU chip, still must interpret the byte code, and byte code instructions require more work than CPU instructions. On the other hand, unlike in classic interpreters, there is still an internal compile step—Python does not need to reanalyze and reparse each source statement’s text repeatedly. The net effect is that pure Python code runs at speeds somewhere between those of a traditional\n",
    "compiled language and a traditional interpreted language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Development implications\n",
    "Another ramification of Python’s execution model is that there is really no distinction between the development and execution environments. That is, the systems that compile and execute your source code are really one and the same.How Python Runs Programsa bit more significance to readers with a background in traditional compiled languages.but in Python, the compiler is always present at runtime and is part of the system that runs programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes for a much more rapid development cycle. There is no need to precompile and link before execution may begin; simply type and run the code. This also adds a much more dynamic flavor to the language—it is possible, and often very convenient,\n",
    "for Python programs to construct and execute other Python programs at runtime. The eval and exec built-ins, for instance, accept and run strings containing Python program code. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least five implementations of the Python language—CPython, Jython, IronPython, Stackless, and PyPy. Although there is much cross-fertilization of ideas and work between these Pythons, each is a separately installed software system, with its own developers and user base.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython: The standard.The original, and standard, implementation of Python is usually called CPython when you want to contrast it with the other options (and just plain “Python” otherwise). This name comes from the fact that it is coded in portable ANSI C language code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jython: Python for Java.The Jython system (originally known as JPython) is an alternative implementation of the Python language, targeted for integration with the Java programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "IronPython: Python for .NET.A third implementation of Python, and newer than both CPython and Jython, IronPython is designed to allow Python programs to integrate with applications coded to workwith Microsoft’s .NET Framework for Windows, as well as the Mono open source equivalent for Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stackless: Python for concurrency.Still other schemes for running Python programs have more focused goals. For example,\n",
    "the Stackless Python system is an enhanced version and reimplementation of the standard CPython language oriented toward concurrency. \n",
    "\n",
    "PyPy: Python for speed.The PyPy system is another standard CPython reimplementation, focused on performance. It provides a fast Python implementation with a JIT (just-in-time) compiler,provides tools for a “sandbox” model that can run untrusted code in a secure environment, and by default includes support for the prior section’s Stackless Python systems and its microthreads to support massive concurrency.\n"
